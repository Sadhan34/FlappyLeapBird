# Flappy Leap Bird

## Description

A clone of the popular game 'Flappy Bird'. Initially developed by [Nebez](https://github.com/nebez/floppybird/), I have expanded the game to enable controlling the Flappy Bird with the [Leap Motion](http://leapmotion.com) controller. This application uses all of the protocols and frameworks used by the original author in addition to the [LeapJS](http://developer.leapmotion.com/leapjs/) API for the Leap Motion.

## Usage

For this game to function correctly, the user must have the Leap Motion client application installed, with the option to enable webapps turned on, as shown below:

The user will have to make a vertical 'flapping' motion with their hand for the game to register a 'flap' in the game.

## Demo

This application is hosted using Github Pages. To use the live demo, navigate to: http://rukmal.github.io/FloppyLeapBird.

## Notice

The assets powering the visual element of the game have all been extracted directly from the Flappy Bird android game.

I do not own the assets, nor do I have explicit permission to use them from their creator. They are the work and copyright of original creator Dong Nguyen and [.GEARS games](http://www.dotgears.com/).
